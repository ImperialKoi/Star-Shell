# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shell Genie is an AI-powered command-line interface agent that integrates with Google's Gemini Pro API to provide intelligent assistance for shell operations. The system will securely manage API credentials, analyze user commands and context, and provide helpful suggestions, explanations, and automated command generation through a conversational interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely configure my Gemini Pro API key, so that the shell genie can authenticate with Google's AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the shell genie for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt for the Gemini Pro API key
2. WHEN the user provides an API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key format and store it securely
3. WHEN the API key is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt or obfuscate the key in local storage
4. IF the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and re-prompt for a valid key
5. WHEN the user wants to update their API key THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration command to change it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the shell genie through a conversational CLI interface, so that I can get AI-powered assistance for my shell operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the shell genie THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and command prompt
2. WHEN the user types a question or command THEN the system SHALL send the input to Gemini Pro API for processing
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in a readable format
4. WHEN the user types 'exit' or 'quit' THEN the system SHALL terminate gracefully
5. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL handle the interrupt and exit cleanly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the shell genie to understand my current working directory and system context, so that it can provide relevant and accurate assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a user request THEN the system SHALL include current working directory in the context sent to the AI
2. WHEN processing a user request THEN the system SHALL include basic system information (OS, shell type) in the context
3. WHEN the user asks about files or directories THEN the system SHALL include relevant file system information in the AI prompt
4. WHEN the AI suggests commands THEN the system SHALL ensure suggestions are appropriate for the current system environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the shell genie to help me generate, explain, and execute shell commands safely, so that I can be more productive and learn from the AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user asks for command suggestions THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate shell commands using the AI
2. WHEN the AI suggests potentially dangerous commands THEN the system SHALL warn the user and ask for confirmation
3. WHEN the user requests command explanation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations of what commands do
4. IF the user wants to execute a suggested command THEN the system SHALL provide an option to run it directly
5. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL capture and display the output to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the shell genie to maintain conversation history during a session, so that I can have contextual follow-up conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty conversation history
2. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL add it to the conversation history
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL add the response to the conversation history
4. WHEN sending requests to the AI THEN the system SHALL include relevant conversation history for context
5. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL optionally save the conversation history for future reference

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the shell genie to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a reliable and stable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and guidance
2. WHEN the Gemini Pro API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry options
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN the AI response is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors and display a fallback message
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and display a user-friendly message
